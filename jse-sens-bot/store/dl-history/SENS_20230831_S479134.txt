          Reporting on our safety results for the period, TRIFRix of 0.32 was an improvement from 0.66 in H1 FY22,
          while the LTIFRx also saw a slight improvement to 0.16 compared to 0.20 for H1 FY22. The Group
          worked 8.8 million person-hours across 17 active project sites and 32 maintenance and operation sites
          for the six-month period to 30 June 2023.                               
                                                                                  
          The Group’s safety performance for the period was subsequently overshadowed by a fatality of an
          employee of one of our contractor partners at the Moyeath project in Saudi Arabia that occurred on 15
          July 2023, where SENET is currently overseeing the construction (EPCM) of the Copper Zinc
          Concentrator. We are deeply saddened by this loss of life and remain committed to and focused on active
          leadership participation and ongoing implementation of awareness programs, setting clear expectations

          The solid H1 FY23 results were underpinned by a high-quality revenue base diversified across regions,
          commodities, clients and service offerings. Group revenue for H1 FY23 was A$424 million, a reduction of
          11% from pcp. The H1 FY22 result included several large fixed-price construction contracts in APAC
          (through the G&S Engineering business), which were loss-making. The Group successfully disposed of
          the G&S Engineering business in September 2022.                         
                                                                                  
          Statutory EBIT increased to A$26.8 million from a loss of A$17.3 million in pcp. Statutory NPAT was
          A$19.4 million compared to a loss of A$16.9 million in pcp. The pcp results were impacted by the
          aforementioned loss-making fixed-price construction contracts.          
                                                                                  
          In discussing the operating results of the Group, and consistent with previous reporting, the focus is on
          underlying profit measures such as Underlying EBITDA, Underlying EBIT and Underlying NPAT. In
          arriving at Underlying EBITDA, EBIT and NPAT, adjustments are made to the statutory results to better
          reflect the underlying performance of DRA.                              
                                                                                  
          Adjustments to exclude from Statutory EBIT and Statutory NPAT in calculating Underlying EBIT and
          Underlying NPAT were:

          Underlying EBIT also significantly improved in the current period and increased to A$23.5 million from a
          loss of A$16.4 million in pcp.                                          
                                                                                  
          The EMEA and Minopex segments continue to deliver strong results, with Underlying EBIT from the
          EMEA segment increasing from A$20.1 million pcp to A$22.7 million, and the Minopex segment
          increasing from A$7.1 million pcp to A$9.0 million.                     
                                                                                  
          With the disposal of the G&S Engineering business in September 2022, the APAC segment has returned
          to its core activities and is starting to see stability in earnings, with Underlying EBIT of A$4.4 million.
          AMER segment’s growth continued as revenue increased from A$33.1 million pcp to A$41.4 million in this
          period, with Underlying EBIT of A$3.7 million in the period.

          The cash position increased by A$8.4 million through the period, and net cash improved by A$29.4 million
          to A$88.5 million. Gearing was reduced from 21.2% to 14.2% with debt reducing through repayment of
          the Global Banking Facility during the period, to further strengthen the balance sheet. The improvement in
          liquidity is a result of the focus on quality of earnings, working capital management and short-term capital
          allocation priorities.

          DRA has appointed Chief Executive Officer James Smith to the Board as Managing Directorxii, alongside
          two additional non-executive directors, Sandra Bell, who will chair the Company’s Audit & Risk
          Committee, and Charles Pettit.xiii These appointments complement the strategic, financial and operational
          experience of our existing Board members.                               
                                                                                  
          Andrew Bickley was appointed as Company Secretary during the periodxiv. 
                                                                                  
          Outlook                                                                 
                                                                                  
          The Group’s pipeline includes an estimated A$4.0 billion of opportunities with A$2.8 billion related to
          Projects and A$1.2 billion related to Operations. The Group’s P1 Pipelinexv is A$705 million as at
          30 June 2023.                                                           
                                                                                  
          At a Group level, the outlook for financial performance in the current half remains positive and broadly
          similar to H1 FY23. DRA will continue to focus on its core strengths of engineering, project delivery and
          operations management, while looking to maintain its diversified revenue streams across geographies,
          service offerings, clients and commodities.                             
                                                                                  
          There remains the potential for profitability to be impacted by shortages of skilled labour, further interest
          rate increases by central banks as the effect flows through financing of future major projects and the
          pipeline for the Group, and inflationary pressures on the Group’s cost base.
                                                                                  
          Through the second half of FY23, the Group’s capital allocation framework continues to prioritise
          strengthening the balance sheet, retaining and investing in our people and sustaining base working
          capital.
