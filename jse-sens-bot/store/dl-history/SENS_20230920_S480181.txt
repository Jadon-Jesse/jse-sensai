                           (“Motus” or “the Company” or “the Group”)              
                                                                                  
                           DEALINGS IN SECURITIES BY DIRECTORS                    
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
        In compliance with paragraphs 3.63 to 3.74 (both inclusive) of the Listings Requirements of JSE Limited, the
        following is disclosed:                                                   
                                                                                  
        In terms of the remuneration policy of the Group, any senior employee with significant managerial or other
        responsibility, including any director holding salaried employment or office in the Group, is eligible to participate
        in the Company’s long-term incentive (“LTI”) schemes. An LTI scheme participant becomes entitled to shares
        after confirmation by the Board that the performance and other conditions have been fulfilled, as set out in the
        relevant grant letter. The vesting of LTIs for the executive directors on 15 September 2023, as announced on
        SENS, consist solely of Conditional Share Plan (“CSP”) awards which were allocated on 15 September 2020
        (“2020 CSP Awards”).                                                      
                                                                                  
        Following the vesting of the CSP awards, the Company is required, within 30 (thirty) days of each vesting date,
        to procure the delivery of that number of shares that have vested to the participant. The participant may elect
        to have all or part of the shares sold on his/her behalf to settle tax obligations and to take delivery of the net
        resulting shares, or cash.                                                
                                                                                  
        Details of the shares sold on behalf of the executive directors to settle their tax obligations arising from the
        vesting of their 2020 CSP Awards is set out below. Save for the shares so sold in order to settle the directors’
        tax obligations, each of the directors has elected to retain the balance of the shares which have vested.
                                                                                  
        The executive directors now hold more shares at 19 September 2023 than they did on 30 June 2023 and their
        shareholding in Motus is in excess of the Minimum Share Holding (MSH) as required in terms of the
        remuneration policy of the group.
