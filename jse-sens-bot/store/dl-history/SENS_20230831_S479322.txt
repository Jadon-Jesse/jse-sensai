          As part of the dual listed company structure, Investec plc and Investec Limited notify both the London Stock
          Exchange and the JSE Limited of matters which are required to be disclosed under the Disclosure

          Capital adequacy and leverage disclosures                                 
          Investec plc and Investec Limited calculate capital resources and requirements using the Basel III
          framework, as implemented in their respective jurisdiction by the Prudential Regulation Authority and South
          African Prudential Authority.                                             
                                                                                    
          The following table sets out the capital and leverage metrics for the Investec plc group, Investec Limited

          ^ The information for Investec plc includes the information for Investec Bank plc. The information for Investec Limited includes the
          information for IBL.                                                      
          * Investec plc’s capital and leverage ratios exclude quarterly profits and associated foreseeable charges and dividends for the period
          1 April to 30 June 2023. In accordance with the Prudential Regulation Authority rules, quarterly profits may only be included in a firm’s
          capital position once the profits have been independently verified by an external audit firm.
          ** Investec Limited’s and IBL’s capital information includes unappropriated profits. If unappropriated profits are excluded from capital
          information, Investec Limited’s and IBL’s CET1 ratio would be 170bps and 221bps lower respectively. The leverage ratio for Investec
          Limited and IBL would be 72bps and 89bps lower respectively.              
          Liquidity Disclosures                                                     
          Liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and net stable funding ratio (NSFR)        
          The objective of the LCR is to promote the short-term resilience of the liquidity risk profile of banks by
          ensuring that they have sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive a significant stress scenario lasting
          30 calendar days. The NSFR promotes the resilience of the banking sector by requiring banks to maintain
          a stable funding profile in relation to the composition of their assets and off-balance sheet activities on an
          ongoing structural basis. By ensuring that banks do not embark on excessive maturity transformation that
          is not sustainable, the NSFR is intended to reduce the likelihood that disruptions to a bank's funding sources
          would erode its liquidity position, increase its risk of failure, and potentially lead to broader systemic risk.

          for IBL (solo basis). IBL group values use daily values for IBL (solo basis), while those for other group entities use the average of April,
          May and June 2023 month-end values.
