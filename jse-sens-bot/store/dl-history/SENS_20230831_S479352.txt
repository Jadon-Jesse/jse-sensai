       The group recorded strong performance for the six months ended 30 June 2023, with all clusters and lines of
       business performing well.                                                  
       The main items contributing to the growth in net result from financial services (NRFFS) are:
                                                                                  
         •  Life insurance benefited from positive risk experience, increased asset-based fee income and improved
            performance from the credit portfolio backing life insurance liabilities,
         •  General insurance benefited from improved underwriting performance and higher investment return on
            insurance funds, and                                                  
         •  Credit and structuring benefited from stronger performance from the Indian operations.
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                      1 | Pa g e  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
       Cash NRFFS represents NRFFS as adjusted for the reversal of specific non-cash items: amortisation of intangible
       assets and the reversal of changes in insurance contract assets (i.e. negative liabilities).
       The higher expected percentage increase in net operational earnings relative to net result from financial services
       is due to higher investment returns on the shareholder capital portfolio, included in net operational earnings.
                                                                                  
       The main contributors to the higher level of growth in HEPS and diluted HEPS relative to net operational earnings
       were non-economic accounting mismatch profits and losses recognised in terms of IFRS, lower amortisation of
       value of business acquired as well as adjustments emanating from the implementation of IFRS 17.
       Lower increase in EPS and diluted EPS relative to HEPS and diluted HEPS is due to lower profit on disposal of
       operations in 2023 relative to 2022, reflected in EPS and diluted EPS.
