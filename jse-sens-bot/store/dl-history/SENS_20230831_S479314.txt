      Lighthouse shareholders are referred to the dividend declaration announcement released on Tuesday, 15 August
      2023 and the circular distributed to shareholders in respect of a cash dividend of 1,35 EUR cents per share, with an
      alternative scrip distribution option of 1,35 EUR cents per share (“Scrip Distribution”).
                                                                                    
      The allocation of new Lighthouse shares will be such that shareholders who elect to receive the Scrip Distribution
      will not be allocated a fraction of a new Lighthouse share and as such any entitlement to receive a fraction of a new
      Lighthouse share will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and the value of the fraction will be paid to
      shareholders, less South African dividend tax at a rate of 20% which may be payable by shareholders liable for
      South African dividend tax.                                                   
      Shareholders are advised that the fraction rate has been calculated as the volume weighted average price of a
      Lighthouse share traded on the JSE on Wednesday, 30 August 2023, of 545,77309 ZAR cents (26,74637 EUR
      cents) converted from EUR at an exchange rate of ZAR 20,4055:EUR 1,00 (determined as the closing foreign
      exchange rate on Wednesday, 30 August 2023) discounted by 10%, being 491,19578 ZAR cents (24,07173 EUR
      cents) per Lighthouse share. The gross fraction rate to be paid will be 491,19578 ZAR cents (24,07173 EUR cents).
      The net fraction rate paid will be 392,95662 ZAR cents (19,25739 EUR cents) per Lighthouse share for payments
      which are subject to South African dividend tax.
