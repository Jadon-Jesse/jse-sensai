          Notes for Editors                                                       
          Glencore is one of the world’s largest global diversified natural resource companies and a major
          producer and marketer of more than 60 commodities that advance everyday life. Through a network of
          assets, customers and suppliers that spans the globe, we produce, process, recycle, source, market and
          distribute the commodities that support decarbonisation while meeting the energy needs of today.
          With around 140,000 employees and contractors and a strong footprint in over 35 countries in both
          established and emerging regions for natural resources, our marketing and industrial activities are
          supported by a global network of more than 40 offices.                  
                                                                                  
          Glencore's customers are industrial consumers, such as those in the automotive, steel, power
          generation, battery manufacturing and oil sectors. We also provide financing, logistics and other
          services to producers and consumers of commodities.                     
          Glencore is proud to be a member of the Voluntary Principles on Security and Human Rights and the
          International Council on Mining and Metals. We are an active participant in the Extractive Industries
          Transparency Initiative.                                                
          We recognise our responsibility to contribute to the global effort to achieve the goals of the Paris
          Agreement by decarbonising our own operational footprint. We believe that we should take a holistic
          approach and have considered our commitment through the lens of our global industrial emissions.
          Against a 2019 baseline, we are committed to reducing our Scope 1, 2 and 3 industrial emissions by 15%
          by the end of 2026, 50% by the end of 2035 and we have an ambition to achieve net zero industrial
          emissions by the end of 2050. For more detail see our 2022 Climate Report on the publication page of
          our website at glencore.com/publications.
