          INTENDED APPOINTMENT OF INTEGRATION OFFICER - LAFARGE TRANSACTION       
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Afrimat shareholders are referred to the SENS announcement released on 20 June 2023 in
          relation to the acquisition of Lafarge South Africa Holdings Proprietary Limited (“LSA”) (“the
          Transaction”).                                                          
                                                                                  
          Given the complexity and importance of the successful implementation of the Transaction
          and the integration of LSA into the Afrimat group, the board will temporarily appoint the
          current chief financial officer (“CFO”) and financial director, Mr Pieter de Wit, as the
          integration officer for the Transaction when it becomes unconditional, for a period of circa 6
          to 10 months. Whilst acting as the integration officer for the Transaction, Mr Pieter de Wit will
          remain as the CFO and financial director of Afrimat and will ultimately remain responsible for
          the financial functions and obligations of Afrimat.                     
                                                                                  
          In order to assist Mr Pieter de Wit, with his CFO and financial director duties over this period,
          certain of his day-to-day responsibilities and duties will be delegated to Mr Andre Smith, a
          qualified CA(SA) who will be appointed as deputy CFO over this interim period. Mr Smith has
          been involved in the finance function at Afrimat for the past 17 years and will be supported
          by a highly competent finance team.
