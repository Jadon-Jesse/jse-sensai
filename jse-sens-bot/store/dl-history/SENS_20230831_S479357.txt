          MTNZF shareholders are advised that the Company’s interims have been released and are available

          MTNZF shareholders are further advised that the unmodified review report of the independent
          auditors, SizweNtsalubaGobodo Grant Thornton Inc., included in the interims, contains the following
          paragraph on material uncertainty relating to going concern: “We draw attention to note 10 in the
          condensed financial statements, which indicates that the provider of the notional vendor finance,
          has provided an expression of intent to support the company for the period 1 April 2024 to 31
          August 2024 to enable it to meet its cash requirements. As stated in note 10, these events or
          conditions, along with other matters as set forth in note 10, indicate that a material uncertainty
          exists that may cast significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as a going concern. Our
          conclusion is not modified in respect of this matter.”                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          MTNZF shareholders' attention is also drawn to notes 4 and 12 of the interims regarding a dispute
          that has arisen between MTNZF and a service provider.
