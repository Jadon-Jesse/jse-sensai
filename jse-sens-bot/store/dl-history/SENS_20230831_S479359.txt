          INTRODUCTION                                                            
                                                                                  
          The Clientèle Group (“the Group”) has produced a reasonable set of results for the year
          against the backdrop of a continuing challenging trading environment, characterised by low
          economic growth, ongoing load-shedding and challenges in the premium collections
          environment.                                                            
                                                                                  
          The previously reported higher than expected policyholder withdrawals continued throughout
          the year. Instability in the collections environment and in the services provided by a third
          party service provider negatively impacted collection success, and consequently increased
          withdrawals.                                                            
          The Group remains in a sound solvency and liquidity position.           
                                                                                  
          The Group achieved an investment return of 10.5% (2022: 4.2%) from its investment
          portfolios.                                                             
                                                                                  
          Take up of the stand-alone Clientèle Rewards product has been extremely encouraging.

          Net insurance premiums for the year of R2.02 billion decreased slightly (by 1.7%) in
          comparison to the prior year (2022 restated: R2.05 billion). Growth was impacted by the
          higher than expected withdrawals mentioned above.                       
                                                                                  
          Revenue from contracts with customers of R342.0 million was 59% higher than last year
          (2022 restated: R214.4 million), on the back of high production of co-branded single
          premium products, an increase in revenue from the stand-alone rewards product and the
          consolidation of revenue from Direct Rewards for the 2023 financial year.

          business to set an assumption based on experience. The net profit increase as a
          consequence of this change was R16.5 million.                           
                                                                                  
          Recurring premium savings policies sold through the Telesales channels that were
          previously accounted for under IFRS4 have now been accounted for under IFRS 9, which
          delays the emergence of profits for this block of business, and the comparative numbers
          have been restated, reducing the 2022 profit after tax by R15.1 million.
                                                                                  
          Net insurance benefits and claims of R387.7 million were 2% higher than the R380.8 million
          in respect of the prior year.                                           
                                                                                  
          The full explicit COVID-19 risk reserve, net of reinsurance, of R26.2 million was released
          during the year.                                                        
          Operating expenses (including acquisition expenses) of R1.7 billion (restated 2022: R1.4
          billion), were 20% higher than last year. The main reason for this was an increase in
          acquisition costs which includes a once-off upfronting of commission (R100 million) in
          respect of a funeral parlour insurance transaction in the current year and an increase of R19
          million in acquisition costs in respect of the increased production of single premium policies.
                                                                                  
          Due to a high client affinity with certain funeral parlours, and corresponding lower withdrawal
          experience on this business, a portion of future funeral parlour profits have been recognised
          during the year as a result of not eliminating negative reserves on this class of business.
          This resulted in an increase in profit after tax of R213.6 million (and a corresponding
          reduction in Value of In-force and a negligible impact on the Embedded Value (“EV”)).
                                                                                  
          The above translates into headline earnings for the Group increasing by 15% to R487.7
          million (2022 restated: R425.7 million) resulting in a return on average shareholders’
          interests of 43% (2022 restated: 40%). Diluted headline earnings per share of
          145.32 cents (2022 restated: 126.8 cents) were 15% higher than last year.
                                                                                  
          Group Embedded Value and Value of New Business                          
          The Group EV at 30 June 2023 increased by 1% from last year and was R5.9 billion (30
          June 2022: R5.8 billion), after the payment of the annual dividend of R402.4 million in
          September 2022, despite the Risk Discount Rate (“RDR”) of 14.1% p.a. having increased
          from 13.8% p.a. at 30 June 2022. Recurring Embedded Value Earnings (“REVE”) of R663.1
          million were negatively impacted by withdrawal losses of R245.4 million, resulting in a
          reduction of 9% in comparison to the prior year result of R724.9 million.
                                                                                  
          The Value of New Business (“VNB”) for the year of R244.9 million (RDR of 14,1% p.a.)
          (2022: R290.6 million (RDR of 13.8% p.a.)) decreased by 16% over last year. In order to be
          in line with the rest of the industry, reinstatements have been removed from new business
          and treated as “negative withdrawals”.                                  
                                                                                  
          As a result, reinstatements are no longer included in the VNB but the impact of
          reinstatements is included as a negative decrement in the VIF. This methodology change
          also affected the withdrawal and expense assumptions for the in-force and new business
          calculations. Furthermore, a change was made (by one of the Reinsurers) to the shape of
          the reinsurance rates curve. These once-off changes had a negative EV impact of R158.3
          million and a negative impact on VNB.                                   
                                                                                  
          The EV and VNB sensitivities are illustrated in the Group EV results on page 22.
                                                                                  
          The Present Value of New Business premiums increased due to large volumes of Single
          Premium investment business written. The relatively low profit margin on this block of
          business has resulted in a marked decrease (to 4.8%) in the overall New Business profit
          margin.                                                                 
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          Other than profit recognition on some of the funeral parlour business mentioned above, the
          Group follows a conservative accounting practice of eliminating negative reserves. As
          acquisition costs are expensed upfront, the recovery of these costs and the profits are
          deferred over the policy life. The present value of this discretionary margin amounts to R2.1
          billion (2022: R2.5 billion).
