          Enhanced operational flexibility, resilience and disciplined execution enabled Implats to successfully
          navigate a series of domestic and regional challenges, which compounded the effects of softening dollar
          pricing, rand depreciation and persistent inflation in the year under review. This is testament to the skills
          and strength of our people, with standout performances at Impala Canada, Zimplats and Impala
          Rustenburg.                                                             
          The year’s highlight was securing ownership of Royal Bafokeng Platinum Limited (RBPlat) and the
          Group is implementing its plans to integrate and optimise the asset to ensure maximum value from this
          important acquisition. The combined asset base of Impala Rustenburg and RBPlat will result in a more
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          secure and sustainable Rustenburg operating complex in years to come, with a premier mine-to-market
          production base, well-capitalised infrastructure and long-term competitive positioning, enhanced by
          industry-leading integrated processing capability and realising material synergies. The Group launched
          the proposed acquisition of RBPlat in November 2021, with an offer of R90.00 in cash and 0.3 Implats
          shares per RBPlat share. The Competition Tribunal approved the transaction on 16 November 2022,
          and the mandatory offer closed on 21 July 2023, with Implats securing 98.91% ownership post year
          end. The compulsory acquisition of the residual shareholding, in terms of Section 124(1) of the
          Companies Act (71 of 2008) as amended, will be effected by 14 September 2023.

          Safe production remains the Group’s foremost priority, with the goal of achieving zero harm to the health
          and safety of our employees and contractors. All safety metrics improved in the period, benefiting from
          a focus on fatal risk control protocols, risk mitigation using leading indicators, visible leadership and
          mine-safety discipline. However, the Group regrettably reported five employee fatalities at managed
          operations during the period (FY2022: seven), and one at joint venture (JV) operation, Two Rivers.
          During the 12 months to end-June 2023, the Group’s fatal-injury frequency rate improved by 29% to
          0.040 per million man-hours worked (FY2022: 0.056). The lost-time injury frequency rate improved by
          7% to 3.92 (FY2022: 4.21) and the all-injury frequency rate by 5% to 9.25 per million man-hours worked
          (FY2022: 9.76). By year end, 13 of the Group’s 18 operations had achieved millionaire or multimillionaire
          status in terms of fatality free shifts.                                
                                                                                  
          Operational summary                                                     
          Tonnes milled from the Group’s managed operations increased by 7% to 23.88 million tonnes (FY2022:
          22.36 million tonnes) with higher reported volumes at each of Impala Rustenburg, Zimplats and Impala
          Canada together with a consolidated contribution of 403 000 tonnes at RBPlat offsetting lower
          throughput at Marula. 6E production at managed operations increased by 6% to 2.42 million ounces
          (FY2022: 2.29 million ounces), and a maiden contribution of 43 000 6E ounces in concentrate from
          RBPlat was recorded for the 30 days to 30 June 2023.                    
                                                                                  
          6E concentrate production of 541 000 ounces from JV operations declined by 1% (FY2022: 548 000
          ounces). Safety stoppages, and intermittent localised community disruptions at Two Rivers exacerbated
          the ongoing impact of split-reef and development tonnage on milled grade. At Mimosa, processing and
          plant stability was impacted by commissioning and optimising the concentrator project, power
          interruptions, changes in reagent supply and poor water quality. Third-party 6E concentrate receipts
          declined by 18% to 287 000 6E ounces, with several operational challenges reported at peer-group
          producers and the termination of two contracts in Q3 FY2023. In total, Group 6E production increased
          by 2% to 3.25 million ounces (FY2022: 3.19 million ounces).             
          In addition to load curtailment at South African managed and JV operations during the period, severe
          load shedding was experienced across the Zimbabwean national grid in March 2023. In total, Implats
          estimates 36 000 6E ounces of production were foregone across southern African managed and JV
          operations during the period. Circa 101 000 6E ounces were deferred due to power constraints at the
          Group’s smelting operations and the consequent delay to restart the refurbished Number 4 furnace in
          Q4 FY2023. A further 10 000 6E ounces were deferred due to cable theft at Impala Rustenburg,
          particularly the instance which resulted in power supply interruptions to the metallurgical complex.
          Group refined 6E production of 2.96 million ounces, including saleable production from Impala Canada
          and RBPlat, declined by 4% (FY2022: 3.09 million ounces), impacted by constrained smelting capacity
          from the scheduled rebuild of Number 4 furnace in Rustenburg and the increased severity and duration
          of load curtailment experienced. Implats ended the period with circa 245 000 6E ounces of excess
          inventory (FY2022: 40 000 ounces).                                      
                                                                                  
          Notable rand depreciation compounded the impact of high consumable and utilities inflation on the
          translated cost and capital expenditure at Zimbabwean and Canadian operations. Total cash operating
          costs increased by 19%, while unit costs benefitted from higher throughput at managed operations and,
          despite lower refined output, increased by 14% to R19 834 per 6E ounces (FY2022: R17 364 per 6E
          ounce).

          Capital expenditure at managed operations rose by 27% to R11.5 billion (FY2022: R9.1 billion) as
          spending on replacement and growth projects accelerated and the rand weakened against the dollar.
          Stay-in-business spend of R7.3 billion, replacement capital of R2.3 billion and expansion capital of R1.9
          billion increased by 16%, 61% and 41%, respectively.

          The Group’s financial performance was negatively impacted by the retracement in rand PGM pricing,
          lower refined production and sales, continued higher levels of inflation, the accounting impact of end-of-
          period inventory valuations and impairments related to Impala Canada and RBPlat, the latter as required
          by its consolidation.

          34%.                                                                    
                                                                                  
          Implats accounted for three significant once-off items in FY2023:       
            •  A R10.9 billion impairment of the carrying value of Impala Canada, due to the combined
               impact of a material decrease in the US dollar palladium price profile and higher prevailing
               inflation                                                          
            •  A loss of R1.8 billion on the remeasurement of the previously held equity investment in RBPlat
               at the date it became a subsidiary of the Group                    
            •  A R4.2 billion impairment of goodwill arising on the acquisition of RBPlat.
                                                                                  
          Basic earnings declined to R4.9 billion or 577 cents per share, from R32.0 billion or 3 856 cents per
          share in FY2022. Headline earnings of R18.8 billion or 2 211 cents per share were 41% and 43% lower,
          respectively. The weighted average number of shares in issue increased to 850.28 million from 831.25
          million, with total issued capital on 30 June 2023 increasing to 866.40 million shares. During FY2023,
          Implats issued 16.18 million shares with a fair value of R2.6 billion, in part consideration for the additional
          18.6% stake acquired in RBPlat.                                         
          The Group generated R14.2 billion in free cash flow, after capital investment of R11.4 billion at its
          managed operations and ended the period with net cash after debt of R25.3 billion and liquidity
          headroom of R37 billion. The board of directors of Implats (board) declared a final dividend of 165 cents
          per share, bringing the total dividend for the year to 585 cents per share.
                                                                                  
          Prospects and outlook                                                   
          There have been several revisions to forecast PGM supply and demand in 2023. Primary supplies
          continue to be challenged by the South African operating environment, while processing maintenance
          will result in lower refined Russian supplies. Forecasts for secondary flows continue to be downgraded
          as scrap collections fall short of expectations in the face of rising interest rates, increased regulatory
          scrutiny and still-weak new vehicle sales.                              
                                                                                  
          While expectations for auto production and sales have enjoyed modest upgrades, forecasts for net metal
          demanded by industrial users have been adjusted down to account for the destocking of inventory.
          Negative revisions to the outlook for Chinese jewellery demand have largely been countered by a
          stronger-than-expected performance in India, the US and Europe.         
          Our forecasts indicate fundamental deficits for each of the PGMs in 2023. However, the potential impact
          and pattern of industrial and auto OEM destocking, particularly in rhodium, and the flow of discounted
          metal flows from Russia will likely heavily influence physical market tightness, and hence pricing, during
          the year.                                                               
                                                                                  
          The uncertain macroeconomic environment and the recent material decline in dollar PGM pricing
          heralded a period of rapid margin compression across the sector, which requires decisive action and
          focus to preserve business sustainability. Implats remains focused on delivering consistent and safe
          production, constructively collaborating with key stakeholders and entrenching operational agility and
          flexibility.                                                            
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                  Page 3 of 6     
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
                                                                                  
          It is imperative that each operation generates positive margins through the cycle. The Group is
          advancing targeted capital and cost interventions in response to the current market conditions. Implats
          will sustain investment across projects key to ensuring regulatory compliance and strategic value
          creation. The commitment is to prioritise shareholder returns, with a dividend policy founded on a
          minimum allocation of free cash flow generated before growth capital.   
          The near-term focus at RBPlat is to optimise costs, improve metallurgical performance, complete the
          Styldrift ramp-up, and plan and implement the medium- and longer-term initiatives to realise the
          synergies provided by the acquisition.                                  
                                                                                  
          The downturn in palladium pricing compounded margin compression from structural changes in the
          operating and cost context faced by Impala Canada, largely due to the aftermath of Covid-19 and the
          subsequent supply-chain constraints, labour market tightness and hyper-inflationary pressures from
          rising global utility and consumables pricing. Teams are working to secure a sustainable value
          proposition for the asset, underpinned by the volume gains and operating momentum established in
          FY2023 — specifically targeting mining from higher-grade areas.         
          Group production in FY2024 will be supported by volume gains from increased milling capacity at
          Zimplats and Two Rivers, while the improved operational stability established at Impala Rustenburg and
          Impala Canada bodes well for further efficiency gains. Concentrate volumes from RBPlat will materially
          alter the production profile for the Group, while third-party receipts reflect expected volumes from pre-
          existing contracts at IRS. Refined volumes will be impacted by the planned rebuild of Number 5 furnace,
          with Group sales in line with refined and saleable production.          
          Group 6E refined production is expected to be between 3.30 and 3.45 million ounces. Group unit costs
          are forecast to rise by between 6% and 10% to between R21 000 per ounce and R22 000 per ounce on
          a stock-adjusted basis. Group capital expenditure is forecast to be between R12.5 billion and R13.5
          billion, inclusive of growth capital of between R3.0 billion and R3.5 billion. This guidance assumes
          exchange rates of R18.25/US$ and C$1.34/US$, respectively.

          DECLARATION OF DIVIDEND                                                 
                                                                                  
          Shareholders are advised that the board has resolved to declare a final gross cash dividend of 165.0
          cents per ordinary share amounting to R1.49 billion at the date of declaration, for the financial year
          ended 30 June 2023. In terms of the approved dividend policy, a minimum dividend of 30% of free cash
          flow pre-growth capital should be declared. The board has the discretion to vary this percentage
          depending on the current and forecast financial performance, as well as market and other factors,
          including sufficiently capitalising the business to allow the Group to take advantage of future value-
          accretive growth opportunities. The dividend has been declared from retained earnings.
          Implats has 903 416 075 ordinary shares in issue and the Company’s tax reference number is
          9700178719. The cash dividend will be subject to a 20% dividend withholding tax for shareholders who
          are not exempt from, or do not qualify for, a reduced rate of withholding tax. Therefore, the net dividend
          amount is 132.0 cents per ordinary share for shareholders liable to pay the dividend withholding tax and
          165.0 cents per ordinary share for shareholders exempt from dividend withholding tax. Shareholders
          are advised to complete the requisite declaration form to make the Company aware of their tax status.
